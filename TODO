TODO:

 - add toastr's (see teamPlayerRating...)
 - add security features (https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/security-rules.html)
    to prevent users from being able to delete orders they do not own
 - add loading spinner (spinnerFactory from teamPlayerRating?)
 - add more auth methods (google, fb, twitter) ?
 - hide timepicker chevrons: added class 'hide' to chevron tr's
    in 'bower_components/angular-bootstrap/ui-bootstrap-tpls.js'
    (see 'template/timepicker/timepicker.html'); use something more solid...
